# Useless Java Stuff

An utterly useless collection of Java code.
All contributions are welcome as long as its uselessness is on par with our standards.

### Optimization (or lack thereof)

This library contains severely unoptimized code.
It is significantly slower than its native Java counterparts.

### Documentation

This library is very well documented.
Every class and method has several lines of JavaDoc copypasta.

### Footnote

This project is a comedic representation of and an homage to the sheer volume
of unnecessary Java boilerplate currently circulating in the industry.
No amount of JavaDoc can fix it.

**Switch to Kotlin. It's much better.**

P.S. *if this library looks anything like your actual code, get some professional mental help*
